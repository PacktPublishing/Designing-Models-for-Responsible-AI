# Chapter 1
## Requirements
```sh
    keras-2.7.0, Tensorflow-2.7.0
```
## Installs
- The first step is to install the necessary libraries and then use the reference samples
	```sh
      pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox 
      pip install git+https://github.com/Koukyosyumei/AIJack
	```

- The next step is to use some of the reference example codes, you can change and try out different parameters, inputs to the same samples
	```sh
