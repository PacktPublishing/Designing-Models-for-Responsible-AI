'''
In this example we learn about ADWIN (ADaptive WINdowing) drift detection mechanism. Adaptive sliding window algorithm is used for detecting change,
and keeping updated statistics about a data stream, thus allowing algorithms for drifting data, to be resistant to this phenomenon.

The general idea is to keep statistics from a window of variable size while detecting concept drift.
The algorithm will decide the size of the window by cutting the statisticsâ€™ window at different points and
analysing the average of some statistic over these two windows. If the absolute value of the difference between
the two averages surpasses a pre-defined threshold, change is detected at that point and all data before that time is discarded.
